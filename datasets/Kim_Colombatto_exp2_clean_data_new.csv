I feel like I answered neutral quite a bit but I do believe a bulk of the people out of12 are not bad people (but I don't know them enough to say they are good people). A lot of these stories require outside information, a better look into their lives, and are situational. A certain story in there had a situation that was tough for everyone and seemed very hard for someone so young to navigate.

I feel like I answered neutral quite a bit but I do believe a bulk of the people out of12 are not bad people (but I don't know them enough to say they are good people). A lot of these stories require outside information, a better look into their lives, and are situational. A certain story in there had a situation that was tough for everyone and seemed very hard for someone so young to navigate.
